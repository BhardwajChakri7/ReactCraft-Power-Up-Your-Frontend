# 🔐 JWT Token

## What is a JWT Token?
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. It is primarily used for authorization.

## Usage in Web Applications
After a user logs in, a JWT token is issued by the backend and returned to the client. The client stores this token and includes it in the header for every subsequent API request.
